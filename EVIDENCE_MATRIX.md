| Category | Allegation (Transcript) | Source / Context | Verification Status | Key Evidence / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Elite Location** | **Semjén Zsolt** owns/uses a hunting lodge in **Gánt**. | "Zsolti bácsi" narrative; allegations of boys being taken there. | 🔴 **Confirmed** | Property records show ownership by his wife/mother. Locals confirm he uses it. Location is adjacent to Bicske. |
| **Elite Location** | **Orbán Family** estate at **Hatvanpuszta** is near Bicske. | General context of power concentration in Fejér county. | 🔴 **Confirmed** | Geographic fact. Hatvanpuszta is minutes from Bicske. |
| **Elite Connection** | **Győző Orbán Jr.** (PM's brother) had access to Bicske Children's Home. | Allegations of wrestling training providing access. | 🔴 **Confirmed** | Official articles (later deleted) documented his wrestling club's presence inside the institution. |
| **Trafficking** | **Bicske** director (Vásárhelyi) supplied boys to external locations. | Witness testimonies (Látó János, Kuslits). | 🟠 **Plausible** | The "Wrestling" connection and the "Hunting Lodge" proximity provide the *logistical* capability. Convictions confirm internal abuse. |
| **Trafficking** | **Szőlő utca** director (Juhász) ran "orgies" for "two ministers." | Whistleblower Gábor Kuslits (former Tegyesz head). | 🟠 **Plausible** | Juhász arrested for trafficking in 2025. The 10-year immunity despite complaints strongly suggests high-level protection. |
| **Intel / Blackmail** | **Lajos Répás** (Pimp) had 300+ calls with **AH** (Constitution Protection). | Reference to "Direkt36" leaks/articles. | 🔴 **Confirmed** | Documented in investigative journalism (Direkt36 "Sex Leaks"). |
| **Intel / Blackmail** | **Tamás Welsz** died in police custody to protect the "Nancy Tape" (Rogán). | Welsz death is public record; "Nancy" connection is witness testimony. | 🟠 **Mixed** | Welsz death is confirmed suspicious (died in police car). Link to Rogán is persistent but formally unproven. |
| **Cover-Up** | **Zoltán Balog** lobbied for the **Bicske Pardon**. | Presidential Pardon Scandal (2024). | 🔴 **Confirmed** | Balog admitted to "supporting" the pardon. Resigned from Synod leadership. |
| **Cover-Up** | **Bence Tuzson** issued a "sham report" on Szőlő utca. | 2025 Ministry Report clearing the institution. | 🔴 **Confirmed** | The report exists and contradicts the subsequent arrest of the director. |
| **Misinfo/Rumor** | **Hilarion** owned the **Vásárosnamény Castle**. | "Suzuki" witness testimony. | ❌ **Debunked** | Hilarion owned a mansion in **Vácduka**, not Vásárosnamény. (Vásárosnamény castle is a museum). |
| **Elite Location** | **Hotel President / City Inn** used as "honey traps." | "Gerendás József" connection; allegations of cameras. | 🟡 **Speculative** | Gerendás connection to Hotel President is real. "Cameras" allegation is unverified but consistent with Intel MO. |
| **Occult** | **Xavér Varnus** puts "curses" on investigators (car accidents). | Ábrahám/Füsi accidents. | 🟡 **Coincidental** | Accidents occurred, but causality is supernatural/unverifiable. Likely psychological warfare or intimidation tactics. |
