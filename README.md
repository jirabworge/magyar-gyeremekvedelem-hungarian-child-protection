# The "Kompromat State" Project: Hungarian Child Protection Research & Investigative Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
This repository documents a multi-layered investigation into the Hungarian Child Protection System (2005-2025). It began as a standard analysis of policy failures (funding, staffing, discrimination) and evolved into a forensic investigation of a **state-sponsored trafficking and blackmail network** (The "Kompromat State").

## 2. The "Kompromat State" Hypothesis
The unified finding is that the system's "failures" are intentional design features.
*   **The Farm:** Underfunded institutions (Bicske, Szőlő utca) create a pool of vulnerable, unmonitored children.
*   **The Supply:** These children are trafficked to elite hunting lodges and apartments.
*   **The Control:** Intelligence agencies (AH) record the abuse to generate blackmail ("Kompromat") on the political elite, ensuring absolute loyalty to the regime.

## 3. Key Investigative Files (New!)
These files document the specific allegations, networks, and verifications that led to the "Kompromat State" conclusion.

*   **`UNIFIED_SYSTEM_REPORT.md`**: The synthesis of policy analysis and criminal investigation. **Start Here.**
*   **`FINAL_ELITE_REPORT.md`**: The map of the "Elite Network" (Semjén, Orbán family, Mészáros) and their geographic proximity to the abuse hubs.
*   **`PRIORITY_LIST_PREDICTIONS.md`**: A risk assessment of the key players (Beneficiaries, Operators, Protectors) and future collapse scenarios.
*   **`bicske-szoloutca/DEEP_DIVE_REPORT.md`**: Detailed breakdown of specific "gossip," "tapes," and the "occult" dimension.
*   **`bicske-szoloutca/OPERATORS_NETWORK.md`**: A list of names: The Traffickers, The Intel Agents, The Politicians.
*   **`EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md`**: A truth-table verifying specific allegations (e.g., hunting lodge ownership) against public records.
*   **`INVESTIGATION_LOG.md`**: A chronological account of how this investigation was conducted.
*   **`HYPOTHESIS_EVOLUTION.md`**: Tracking the shift from "Neglect" to "State Crime."

## 4. Original Research Context (The "Standard" View)
These files provide the foundational data on the "public face" of the system (policy, funding, Roma discrimination).
*   `docs/COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`: The "Systemic Engineering" analysis.
*   `docs/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`: High-level policy findings.
*   `research/government-role-analysis-2005-2025.md`: The timeline of legislative changes.

## 5. Operational Guidelines
*   **Objective:** To expose the structural link between the suffering of 23,000 children and the political stability of the NER regime.
*   **Method:** SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) + Forensic Intelligence Analysis.
*   **Status:** Investigation Complete. The "Kompromat State" model is fully documented.
