# Gemini Project Context: Hungarian Child Protection Research & AI Agent Framework

## 1. Project Overview
This repository serves a dual purpose:
1.  **Critical Research:** A comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the Hungarian Child Protection System (2005-2025), documenting systemic failures, abuse, and policy issues.
2.  **AI Agent Workbench:** A highly configured environment for AI agent coordination, utilizing the "Claude-Flow" and "SPARC" methodologies for complex task execution, which you are now inhabiting.

## 2. Research Context (Subject Matter)
The core content focuses on the "intentional systemic engineering" of failure in the Hungarian child care system.
*   **Key Findings:** 3 vectors of failure (Human Capital Entropy, Structural Protection of Failure, Poverty Triage/Bias).
*   **Major Scandals:** Szőlő utca Reformatory (trafficking), Bicske (presidential pardon scandal), Ózd Region (segregation).
*   **Statistics:** 23,000 children in care; 800:1 spending ratio favoring family policy over child protection.
*   **Language:** Content is available in both Hungarian (`_HU` suffixes) and English.

## 3. Operational Guidelines (AI Workflow)
This environment is set up for advanced AI interaction. While derived from "Claude-Flow", these principles apply to efficient Gemini usage:
*   **SPARC Methodology:** Specification -> Pseudocode -> Architecture -> Refinement -> Completion.
*   **Batching & Concurrency:** High value is placed on doing *multiple things in one turn*.
    *   *Bad:* Read file -> Wait -> Write file -> Wait.
    *   *Good:* Read related files + Write Plan + Execute Commands in a single sequence where possible.
*   **File Hygiene:**
    *   **DO NOT** create new files in the root directory (except `GEMINI.md` as requested).
    *   Use `docs/`, `research/`, or specific src directories.
    *   Maintain the bilingual structure (English/Hungarian counterparts).

## 4. Directory Structure Overview
*   `docs/`: Primary reports (Executive Summaries, Comprehensive Analysis).
*   `research/`: Detailed breakdown of stakeholders, government roles, and pattern analysis.
*   `.claude/`: Definitions for AI agents, prompts, and workflows (Legacy/Framework context).
*   `.claude-flow/`: Metrics and flow data.
*   `bicske-szoloutca/`: Evidence/Data specific to the Bicske/Szőlő utca cases.

## 5. Key Commands & Tools
*   **Build/Run:** The project uses `npm` (`package.json` exists).
    *   `npm run build`, `npm run test` (Standard commands).
*   **Agent Coordination:** The `package.json` includes `@vibe-kit` dependencies, suggesting programmatic agent control.

## 6. User Preferences
*   **Evidence-Based:** Cite specific files when discussing research findings.
*   **No Hallucinations:** Stick strictly to the provided markdown files for facts about the Hungarian system.
*   **Bilingual Awareness:** Be prepared to switch between English and Hungarian based on the user's prompt or the file context.
