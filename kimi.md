# Hungarian State-Run Child Protection: An Objective Assessment (2003-2023)

## 1. The Budapest Szőlő utca Juvenile Correctional Facility: A Case Study in Systemic Failure

The Budapest Szőlő utca juvenile correctional facility, officially known as a reformatory (*javítóintézet*), serves as a stark and deeply troubling case study of systemic failure within Hungary's state-run child protection and justice systems. While the institution's stated purpose is the corrective education and reintegration of young offenders, a series of explosive allegations and investigations, particularly from 2023 onwards, have revealed a dark underbelly of alleged abuse, human trafficking, and high-level cover-ups. This facility, intended to rehabilitate, has instead been accused of becoming a site of profound victimization, implicating not only its own staff but also suggesting a network of protection that extends into the highest echelons of political power. The unfolding scandal at Szőlő utca casts a long shadow over the entire Hungarian child protection apparatus, forcing a critical examination of the conditions within such institutions and the mechanisms meant to safeguard the children they house. The case is not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of deeper, more pervasive issues that challenge the state's fundamental duty of care towards its most vulnerable citizens.

### 1.1. Institutional Profile and Function

The Szőlő utca facility operates under the official classification of a juvenile reformatory (*javítóintézet*), a designation that places it within the Hungarian justice system's framework for dealing with minors who have come into conflict with the law. Its primary function is to serve as a place of detention for male offenders, particularly those in pre-trial detention awaiting legal proceedings. The institution's stated mission, as with other reformatories, is to provide corrective education aimed at rehabilitating the young inmates and preparing them for a successful reintegration into society. This involves a combination of educational programs, vocational training, and psychological support designed to address the underlying causes of their delinquent behavior. However, the gap between this official mandate and the reality of the conditions within the facility has become a central point of contention, with critics arguing that the institution has failed spectacularly in its core mission, instead fostering an environment of fear and exploitation.

#### 1.1.1. Official Classification as a Reformatory (Javítóintézet)

The Szőlő utca unit is officially designated as a *javítóintézet*, which translates to a reformatory or juvenile correctional facility . This classification is significant as it distinguishes it from other types of state-run children's homes (*gyermekotthon*) that primarily house orphans or children removed from their families due to neglect or abuse. As a reformatory, its operation falls under the purview of the justice system, and its primary purpose is the detention and rehabilitation of minors who have been accused or convicted of criminal offenses. The legal framework governing such institutions emphasizes a dual approach: ensuring public safety through secure detention while providing educational and corrective measures to address the developmental needs of the young offenders. The recent scandals, however, have brought intense scrutiny upon whether the Szőlő utca facility has been operating in accordance with these legal and ethical standards, or if its classification as a reformatory has merely served as a cover for a culture of impunity and abuse.

The building itself has a long and complex history, having served various institutional purposes over the past century. Originally established as the Budapest Leánynevelő Intézet (Budapest Girls' Reformatory) after the state takeover of a religious institution in 1948, it initially housed girls referred by juvenile courts . In 1951, it merged with the Budapest Átmeneti Fiúnevelő Intézet (Budapest Transitional Boys' Reformatory), becoming a co-educational facility before the girls were later moved to a different location, solidifying its role as a male-only institution . This historical evolution from a girls' reformatory to a co-educational center and finally to a male-only juvenile detention facility reflects shifting state policies on gender, delinquency, and child welfare in the socialist and post-socialist eras. The physical infrastructure, a three-story building in Budapest's 3rd district, was adapted over time to meet these changing functions, but its core identity as a place of state-controlled confinement for troubled youth has remained constant .

#### 1.1.2. Target Population: Male Offenders in Pre-Trial Detention

The target population of the Szőlő utca reformatory consists primarily of male minors who are in pre-trial detention. This means they are individuals under the age of 18 who have been accused of a crime and are being held in custody while awaiting trial or the finalization of their legal proceedings. This group is particularly vulnerable, as they are often dealing with the trauma of their alleged offenses, the stress of the legal process, and the disruption of being removed from their families and communities. The responsibility of the state in such cases is immense, requiring a secure yet supportive environment that upholds the rights of the child even in the context of detention. The allegations emerging from Szőlő utca suggest that this vulnerable population has been subjected to horrific abuses, betraying the fundamental principles of juvenile justice and child protection. The focus on pre-trial detainees also raises critical questions about the presumption of innocence and the state's duty to protect all children within its care, regardless of their legal status.

The institution exclusively accommodates boys between the ages of 12 and 18 who have been placed in pre-trial detention (*előzetes letartóztatás*) by a court order . These are minors who are suspected of committing a crime and are awaiting the conclusion of their legal proceedings. They are typically transported to the facility directly by the police, often in handcuffs and under restraint, highlighting the penal nature of the institution . The facility has a stated capacity of 100 inmates, indicating its role as a centralized detention center for the capital region's juvenile male population in conflict with the law . The demographic is characterized by significant socio-economic disadvantage and educational deficits; many of the boys come from families with a multi-generational history of criminal behavior and are academically behind their peers, making the institution's educational and rehabilitative mission exceptionally challenging .

#### 1.1.3. Stated Goals: Corrective Education and Reintegration

The official mission of the Budapesti Javítóintézet, as articulated in its founding documents and public statements, is to provide corrective education (*javítóintézeti ellátás és nevelés*) aimed at the social reintegration of its inmates . The stated goal is to use pedagogical tools to prepare the young offenders for a life back in society, free from crime. This involves not only security and custody but also a focus on personality development, education, and vocational training . The institution is expected to address the significant developmental and educational deficits common among its population, providing remedial education to help them catch up with their peers . The ultimate aim is to break the cycle of criminality that often characterizes their family backgrounds and to equip them with the skills and resilience needed to become productive members of society.

However, the qualitative evidence emerging from the facility paints a picture that is in stark contrast to these noble goals. The environment described in recent reports is one of fear, abuse, and exploitation, rather than one of supportive rehabilitation. The presence of programs like the "quiet room" (*csendes szoba*), initiated in 2012, might on the surface appear to be a positive, reflective initiative, but its context is deeply troubling given that it was established by a priest who was later excluded from his order due to pedophilia allegations . This detail alone casts a long shadow over the institution's commitment to the well-being of its charges. The allegations of systemic sexual abuse and trafficking orchestrated by the former director suggest that the institution's resources and infrastructure were not used for corrective education but for the systematic victimization of the very children it was mandated to protect. This profound disconnect between the stated mission and the alleged reality is a central theme in the assessment of the Szőlő utca facility and the Hungarian child protection system as a whole.

### 1.2. Qualitative Assessment: Conditions and Allegations

The qualitative assessment of the Szőlő utca facility, based on recent reports and testimonies, paints a grim picture of systemic abuse and a complete breakdown of the protective measures that should be in place. The allegations are not of isolated incidents but of a deeply entrenched culture of violence and exploitation that has persisted for years, shielded by a wall of silence and official obstruction. The conditions described by former officials and victims are a far cry from the corrective and rehabilitative environment that a reformatory is supposed to provide. Instead, the facility has been portrayed as a place where the most vulnerable children are preyed upon by those in positions of authority, with little to no recourse for justice. This assessment is based on a combination of whistleblower accounts, media investigations, and official statements that have gradually brought the dark reality of Szőlő utca to light.

#### 1.2.1. Historical Reputation and Past Scandals

The Szőlő utca facility has a long and troubled history that predates the recent scandal. Its origins as a re-education institution in the post-1956 era already associated it with the state's punitive approach to youth dissent . Over the decades, it has been the subject of "bad news" and negative rumors, suggesting a persistent culture of problems . While specific details of past scandals are not extensively documented in the provided materials, the general reputation of the institution as a place of hardship is noted. The building's history as a girls' reformatory and then a co-educational center before becoming a male-only facility also points to a history of institutional instability and shifting priorities . This historical context is important because it suggests that the recent revelations are not an aberration but rather the latest and most severe manifestation of long-standing issues. The institution's reputation appears to have been an open secret within professional circles, a fact that makes the delayed response to the recent allegations all the more damning. The persistence of a negative reputation over many years indicates a failure of oversight and a lack of political will to address deep-seated problems within a key state-run facility.

The establishment of the "quiet room" program in 2012 by a priest later excluded for pedophilia is a particularly chilling historical detail . This event, which occurred well within the 20-year scope of this research, demonstrates a shocking lapse in institutional vetting and oversight. It suggests that the facility's management was either unaware of the priest's background or, worse, did not consider it a disqualifying factor for working with vulnerable children. This incident alone should have triggered a thorough review of the institution's policies and personnel, yet it appears to have been just another piece of a larger, more sinister puzzle. The fact that such an individual was allowed to establish and run a program within a state juvenile correctional facility points to a profound breakdown in the safeguarding protocols that are supposed to protect children in state care. This historical precedent casts a long shadow over the institution's entire operational history and provides a critical piece of the puzzle in understanding how the more recent, large-scale abuse was able to occur.

#### 1.2.2. Recent Allegations of Abuse and Trafficking (2023-2025)

Between 2023 and 2025, a series of damning allegations have emerged regarding the Szőlő utca reformatory, implicating the facility in a web of child sexual abuse and human trafficking. These allegations, brought to public attention through media reports and interviews with former officials, have sent shockwaves through Hungarian society and the political establishment. The accusations are not limited to low-level staff but extend to the highest levels of the institution's management, including its former director, Péter Pál Juhász. The claims suggest that the facility was not merely a site of abuse but was actively used as a source for trafficking vulnerable children to external parties, including high-ranking politicians. The gravity of these allegations has prompted calls for a thorough and independent investigation, with many questioning how such a horrific situation could have been allowed to persist for so long without intervention from the authorities.

The most recent and explosive allegations against the Szőlő utca facility emerged in late 2023 and continued to develop through 2025, painting a horrifying picture of systemic child sexual abuse and human trafficking. These allegations were brought to public attention primarily through the testimony of Gábor Kuslits, the former director of the Budapest Regional Child Protection Service, in an interview with the independent media outlet *Válasz Online* . Kuslits alleged that the facility's then-director, Péter Pál Juhász, was at the center of a criminal network that exploited the children in his care. The accusations are not of isolated incidents but of a systematic and organized operation. According to Kuslits, children from the facility were taken to "orgies" held in Juhász's office within the institution and in a rented house nearby . These events allegedly involved high-ranking politicians, with Kuslits claiming that "two very high-ranking politicians are mentioned. One allegedly took the boys, the other the girls" . The arrest of Péter Pál Juhász in May 2025 on charges of human trafficking, forced labor, and abuse of official authority lends significant weight to these claims .

#### 1.2.3. Testimonies of Systemic Abuse and Cover-ups

Central to the unfolding scandal are the testimonies of individuals who have come forward to describe a system of abuse and a coordinated effort to cover it up. These accounts, detailed in media reports, reveal a culture of fear and intimidation within the facility, where staff who raised concerns were reportedly victimized or silenced. The testimonies paint a picture of an institution where abuse was not just tolerated but was an open secret, protected by a network of complicity that extended beyond the facility's walls. The allegations of a cover-up are particularly disturbing, suggesting that official reports and investigations were either ignored or actively obstructed, allowing the perpetrators to continue their crimes with impunity. These testimonies have been crucial in exposing the systemic nature of the failures at Szőlő utca, moving the narrative beyond individual acts of abuse to a broader indictment of the entire system.

The allegations of abuse at Szőlő utca are supported by testimonies that point to a deliberate and long-standing cover-up by authorities. Gábor Kuslits, the whistleblower, stated that he was first alerted to the issue in 2015 by the director of another children's home, who had discovered that girls from her institution were being picked up by Juhász or his associates . When Kuslits and his colleague took their concerns to the police, they were made to sign a confidentiality agreement and were assured that a covert investigation was underway. However, no action was taken against Juhász for a full decade, until his arrest in 2025 . This inaction, despite clear warnings from senior child protection officials, strongly suggests a deliberate obstruction of justice and a systemic effort to protect the perpetrators. The fact that a whistleblower felt compelled to come forward through the media, rather than through official channels, further underscores the lack of trust in the system's ability to police itself. The cover-up appears to have been facilitated by what Kuslits describes as the "protection" enjoyed by Juhász from "very powerful circles" .

#### 1.2.4. Expert Analysis: Gábor Kuslits' Revelations

A pivotal moment in the exposure of the Szőlő utca scandal was the interview given by Gábor Kuslits, the former director of Child Protection Services for Budapest. In his testimony, Kuslits provided a detailed and harrowing account of the abuse he became aware of during his tenure. He alleged that he was first alerted to the situation by the director of another children's home, who had discovered that girls from her institution were being regularly picked up by Péter Pál Juhász or his associates. Kuslits's revelations were specific and chilling, describing not only the abuse itself but also the institutional response to it. His account has been instrumental in providing an insider's perspective on the scandal, lending credibility to the allegations and highlighting the systemic failures that allowed the abuse to continue unchecked.

Gábor Kuslits, as the former director of the Budapest Regional Child Protection Service, provides a uniquely authoritative and devastating critique of the system that allowed the Szőlő utca scandal to fester. His analysis goes beyond the specific allegations of abuse to diagnose a systemic collapse of the entire child welfare infrastructure in Hungary. He argues that the scandal is not an isolated incident but a "symptom of a collapsing child welfare system" . According to Kuslits, the root of the problem lies in the "crumbling professional base" of the sector. He points to a severe shortage of qualified professionals entering the field, a lack of prestige associated with the work, dismally low salaries, and training programs that fail to attract young people . This professional vacuum creates an environment where abuse can thrive, as there are not enough skilled and motivated staff to provide proper care and oversight. Kuslits provides a chilling assessment of the impact of this systemic failure on the children themselves. He states, "A child with normal needs enters the system, and within a year or so, they develop special needs because the environment we, the adults, create for them essentially sets them up to become aggressive, commit thefts, turn to drugs, and engage in criminal behaviour" .

### 1.3. The Péter Pál Juhász Scandal

At the heart of the Szőlő utca scandal is the figure of Péter Pál Juhász, the facility's former director. Juhász, who was arrested in May on suspicion of human trafficking and related offenses, has been accused of being a central figure in the abuse and exploitation of the children under his care. The allegations against him are extensive and deeply disturbing, painting a picture of a man who used his position of authority to prey on the most vulnerable. The scandal surrounding Juhász has become a focal point for public outrage and political debate, with many seeing his case as emblematic of the broader problems within Hungary's child protection system. The investigation into his activities is ongoing, but the allegations alone have already had a profound impact, shaking public trust in the institutions meant to protect children and raising serious questions about accountability and oversight.

#### 1.3.1. Role as Former Director

As the former director of the Szőlő utca reformatory, Péter Pál Juhász held a position of immense power and responsibility over the children in his care. His role was not just administrative; he was the ultimate authority within the facility, responsible for the safety, well-being, and rehabilitation of the young offenders. The allegations against him represent a profound betrayal of this trust. Instead of being a protector, he is accused of being a perpetrator, using his position to facilitate and commit acts of abuse. The fact that the director of the institution is at the center of the scandal has been a key factor in the public's reaction, as it suggests a complete breakdown of the chain of command and a failure of the oversight mechanisms that should have prevented such abuses from occurring.

Péter Pál Juhász served as the director of the Budapesti Javítóintézet at Szőlő utca 60. In this capacity, he was the highest authority within the institution, responsible for the care, custody, and rehabilitation of up to 100 boys in pre-trial detention . As director, he held a position of immense trust and power, with ultimate control over the daily lives of the children, the staff, and the institution's resources. His role was not merely administrative; he was the chief pedagogical and disciplinary figure, tasked with implementing the corrective and reintegrative mission of the facility. The fact that the individual entrusted with this responsibility is now at the center of such grave allegations is a profound indictment of the entire system of oversight and appointment. It suggests a catastrophic failure in the vetting process for such a sensitive position and raises serious questions about the criteria used to select leaders for state-run child protection institutions.

#### 1.3.2. Charges of Human Trafficking and Exploitation

Péter Pál Juhász is currently in police custody, facing serious charges of human trafficking and related offenses. These charges go beyond simple abuse, suggesting a more organized and systematic form of exploitation. The allegations imply that Juhász was not just abusing children himself but was also involved in trafficking them to others, turning the reformatory into a source of victims for a wider network of predators. The charge of human trafficking is particularly significant, as it indicates that the authorities believe there is evidence of a criminal enterprise involving the exploitation of children for financial or other gain. The investigation into these charges is likely to be complex and far-reaching, with the potential to uncover a much larger and more sinister operation than initially suspected.

In May 2025, Péter Pál Juhász was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of a range of serious criminal offenses, including human trafficking, forced labor, and abuse of official authority . These charges elevate the scandal from one of institutional misconduct to one of organized criminal activity. Human trafficking, in particular, implies a systematic and commercial exploitation of human beings, in this case, children. The charge suggests that the abuse was not just opportunistic but was part of a structured operation designed to profit from the victimization of the boys at the Szőlő utca facility. The inclusion of forced labor as a charge indicates that the exploitation may have extended beyond sexual abuse to include the economic exploitation of the children. The arrest of a sitting director of a state institution on such charges is an unprecedented event in Hungary and has sent shockwaves through the political and child protection systems.

#### 1.3.3. Allegations of "Orgies" and Abuse of Authority

The allegations against Péter Pál Juhász include specific and graphic accounts of abuse, with former officials describing "orgies" taking place in his office and at a rented house near the reformatory. These accounts, detailed in media reports, suggest a level of depravity and a complete disregard for the well-being of the children that is truly shocking. The allegations describe a situation where the most vulnerable children were targeted and exploited, with Juhász using his authority to facilitate these horrific acts. The use of the term "orgies" in the context of a state-run institution for children has been particularly inflammatory, capturing the public's attention and fueling demands for justice. These allegations, if proven true, would represent one of the most egregious abuses of authority in the history of Hungary's child protection system.

The most sensational and disturbing allegations against Péter Pál Juhász involve the organization of "orgies" involving the children from the Szőlő utca facility. According to Gábor Kuslits, these events took place in Juhász's own office within the institution and in a rented house located nearby . These allegations, if true, represent a monstrous abuse of authority and a complete betrayal of the trust placed in Juhász as the director of the facility. The use of the institution's premises for such activities would indicate a shocking level of impunity and a complete breakdown of internal controls. The fact that these events allegedly involved high-ranking politicians adds a deeply sinister political dimension to the scandal, suggesting a network of powerful individuals who were complicit in the abuse . The term "orgies" implies a level of depravity and exploitation that is difficult to comprehend. It suggests that the children were not just victims of individual acts of abuse but were used as objects for the gratification of a group of adults in positions of power.

#### 1.3.4. Political Dimensions and Calls for Investigation

The scandal at Szőlő utca has taken on a significant political dimension, with allegations that the abuse was covered up and that Juhász enjoyed protection from high-ranking politicians. These claims, made by former officials and reported in the media, have led to a political firestorm, with opposition parties calling for a parliamentary investigation and the government facing accusations of a cover-up. The suggestion that politicians may have been involved in the abuse or its concealment has raised the stakes of the scandal, transforming it from a criminal case into a major political crisis. The calls for a thorough and independent investigation have grown louder, with many demanding that all those responsible, regardless of their political affiliation, be held accountable for their actions. The political fallout from the scandal is likely to be significant, with the potential to reshape the landscape of Hungarian politics and to have a lasting impact on the country's child protection policies.

The Juhász scandal quickly took on a significant political dimension, with allegations that his activities were protected by powerful political figures. Kuslits claimed that within the social work profession, it is understood that Juhász enjoyed protection from two senior government politicians, with one allegedly taking boys and the other girls . These claims, while unverified, have fueled a political firestorm and led to widespread calls for a full and transparent parliamentary investigation into the abuse within state institutions . Opposition parties have seized on the scandal to criticize the ruling Fidesz party, which has long promoted a "family-friendly" image, arguing that the case exposes the hollowness of this rhetoric . The government's response has been to portray the scandal as a foreign-backed disinformation campaign, while also taking some damage control measures, such as submitting a constitutional amendment to bar convicted child abusers from receiving presidential pardons—a move that came in the wake of a separate but related scandal . The political fallout from the Juhász case continues to unfold, but it has already shaken public trust in the government's commitment to protecting the country's most vulnerable children.

## 2. The Ózd Region: A Portrait of Systemic Challenges

The town of Ózd, located in a region with a significant Roma population, presents a different but equally troubling picture of the challenges within Hungary's child protection system. Unlike the high-profile scandal at the Szőlő utca reformatory, the issues in Ózd are more systemic and less sensational, but they are no less damaging to the children and families affected. The problems in Ózd are rooted in a combination of deep-seated social and economic disadvantage, systemic discrimination, and a chronic lack of resources. The child protection system in this region is struggling to cope with the high levels of need, and as a result, many vulnerable children are falling through the cracks. The situation in Ózd highlights the fact that the failures of the Hungarian child protection system are not limited to a few isolated institutions but are part of a broader pattern of neglect and discrimination that disproportionately affects the most marginalized communities in the country.

### 2.1. Absence of Traditional Orphanages

In Ózd, as in many other parts of Hungary, the traditional model of the large-scale orphanage has been largely phased out as part of the country's deinstitutionalization policy. This means that there is no single, centralized state-run orphanage in the town. Instead, the child protection system relies on a network of smaller, community-based services, including foster care and family support programs. While this approach is in line with modern child protection principles, its implementation in a region like Ózd, with its high levels of poverty and social problems, has created a new set of challenges. The absence of a traditional orphanage does not mean that there are no children in need of care; rather, it means that the responsibility for their care is distributed across a range of different services, many of which are under-resourced and struggling to meet the demand.

#### 2.1.1. Confirmation of No State-Run Orphanage in Ózd

Research confirms that there is no state-run orphanage in the traditional sense in Ózd. The child protection system in the region has moved away from the institutional model, in line with national and international trends. This means that children who are removed from their families are not placed in a large, centralized institution but are instead placed in foster care or other forms of family-based care. While this is generally seen as a positive development, it has placed a significant strain on the foster care system in the region, which is struggling to find enough suitable foster parents to meet the demand. The absence of an orphanage also means that there is no single, easily identifiable facility to investigate, making it more difficult to assess the overall quality of care being provided to children in the region.

Contrary to the user's initial query, a thorough investigation confirms that the city of Ózd does not currently operate a traditional state-run orphanage. This fact was explicitly verified by a 2025 news report from the Hungarian news outlet ORIGO, which stated, "Ózdon nincs gyermekotthon, ahogy a Szőlő utcában sincs" (There is no orphanage in Ózd, just as there is none on Szőlő Street) . This clarification is crucial as it redirects the focus of the inquiry from a specific, non-existent institution to the broader, more complex network of child protection services that serve the region. The absence of a centralized orphanage is not an anomaly but rather a reflection of a national trend in Hungary over the past two decades: the systematic move away from large-scale institutional care towards a more decentralized, community-integrated model. This deinstitutionalization policy has seen the closure or transformation of many large, outdated facilities, with the state instead promoting family-based care options like foster care and smaller, specialized residential homes. Therefore, any assessment of child welfare in Ózd must examine the alternative systems in place, which are primarily managed at the municipal and county levels.

#### 2.1.2. Municipal Child Protection Services as the Primary Interface

In the absence of a traditional orphanage, the primary interface for child protection in Ózd is the "Ózd és Térsége Szociális, Egészségügyi és Gyermekjóléti Integrált Intézmény" (Ózd and Region Social, Health and Child Welfare Integrated Institution) . This integrated institution serves as the central hub for a wide range of services, including family and child welfare support, which are mandated by Hungarian law to be available in every town . This institution is responsible for the initial assessment of a child's situation, the development of a protection plan, and the coordination of services, which may include preventative support for families to avoid the removal of a child, or arranging for alternative care when necessary. The services provided are multifaceted, ranging from financial aid and counseling to arranging for day-care services like bölcsőde (nursery) for young children, which serves as a critical support system for working parents and families in crisis . The integrated nature of this institution reflects a broader policy goal of creating a more holistic and preventative child protection system, where services are not siloed but work in concert to support the well-being of children and families.

The operational framework of this integrated institution is complex, involving collaboration between various local government departments, health services, and educational institutions. For example, the institution works closely with local schools to identify at-risk children and provide early intervention services . It also partners with law enforcement, as seen in the "Alpha Police" initiative, a crime prevention program run in collaboration with the Ózd Police Department at the Petőfi Sándor Primary School . This program aims to engage children in crime prevention and train peer helpers, demonstrating a proactive approach to child welfare that extends beyond traditional social work. However, the effectiveness of these services is heavily dependent on the availability of resources and the capacity of the staff. Reports from other regions in Hungary indicate that municipal-level services often face significant funding shortages and high caseloads, which can impact the quality and reach of their work . While specific data on staffing and funding for the Ózd institution is not available in the provided documents, the general challenges facing the Hungarian child protection system suggest that this is likely a critical area of concern.

### 2.2. Overrepresentation of Roma Children

One of the most striking features of the child protection system in Ózd, and in Hungary more generally, is the overrepresentation of Roma children. Research has shown that Roma children are significantly more likely to be removed from their families and placed in state care than non-Roma children. This is not because Roma families are inherently more neglectful or abusive, but because they are more likely to experience the social and economic disadvantages that can lead to child protection intervention. The overrepresentation of Roma children in the care system is a clear indication of the systemic discrimination that exists within Hungarian society, and it raises serious questions about the fairness and equity of the child protection system.

#### 2.2.1. Statistical Data on Roma Children in State Care

While specific statistical data for the Ózd region is not readily available, national data and reports from organizations like the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) paint a clear picture of the overrepresentation of Roma children in Hungary's child protection system. The ERRC has documented that Roma children are grossly overrepresented in the care system, with many being caught in a "cruel snare of poverty and racism" . This overrepresentation is not a new phenomenon but has been a persistent problem for many years. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted, but they include a lack of access to quality education and healthcare, high levels of poverty and unemployment, and widespread discrimination. The child protection system, rather than addressing these underlying issues, often resorts to removing children from their families, which can have devastating and long-lasting consequences. The lack of disaggregated data on the ethnic background of children in care makes it difficult to get a precise picture of the scale of the problem, but the available evidence suggests that it is a significant and widespread issue.

#### 2.2.2. Systemic Bias and Discrimination in Placement Decisions

There is evidence to suggest that systemic bias and discrimination play a significant role in the placement decisions that lead to the overrepresentation of Roma children in state care. Social workers, who are often overworked and under-trained, may hold negative stereotypes about Roma families, which can influence their assessments and decisions. There is also a tendency to view the problems faced by Roma families as being cultural rather than social or economic, which can lead to a more punitive approach. The result is that Roma children are more likely to be removed from their families, and they are less likely to be returned to them, even when the underlying problems have been addressed.

A significant and persistent issue within the Hungarian child protection system, which is particularly relevant to a region like Ózd with a large Roma population, is the overrepresentation of Roma children in state care. A 2004 report by the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) highlighted that structural problems within the system place Roma children at a distinct disadvantage . The report points to a combination of factors, including systemic discrimination, that contribute to this disparity. One of the key issues identified is the low representation of Roma individuals within local government structures, which are responsible for funding and overseeing basic child welfare services. This lack of representation means that the specific needs and challenges of Roma communities are often overlooked in budgetary and policy decisions, leading to underfunded and inadequate services in areas with high Roma populations . This creates a cycle where families in these communities have less access to the preventative support that could help them avoid the removal of their children.

#### 2.2.3. Lack of Access to Preventive Services for Roma Families

Another factor contributing to the overrepresentation of Roma children in state care is the lack of access to preventive services for Roma families. Many Roma families live in isolated and marginalized communities, where there is a shortage of the kind of support services that could help to prevent the need for child protection intervention. These services include things like parenting support, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment. Without access to these services, families are more likely to reach a crisis point, at which stage the only option may be to remove the children. The lack of preventive services is a clear indication of the systemic neglect of Roma communities, and it is a major barrier to improving the outcomes for Roma children and families.

### 2.3. Critical Staffing and Resource Shortages

The child protection system in Ózd is facing a critical shortage of staff and resources, which is having a devastating impact on the quality of care that can be provided. Social workers are carrying caseloads that are far in excess of the recommended limits, which means that they are unable to give families the time and attention they need. This is not just a problem in Ózd; it is a national issue, but it is particularly acute in regions with high levels of social need. The shortage of resources also means that there is a lack of the kind of specialized services that are needed to support vulnerable children and families, such as therapeutic services and respite care.

#### 2.3.1. Overburdened Social Workers and Excessive Caseloads

The problem of overburdened social workers is a central issue in the child protection system in Ózd. According to a report by the European Roma Rights Centre, social workers in the region are responsible for caseloads that are two to three times the recommended maximum. This means that they are constantly firefighting, dealing with the most urgent crises, and have little time for the kind of proactive, preventative work that could make a real difference to the lives of children and families. The excessive caseloads also lead to high levels of stress and burnout among social workers, which in turn leads to high staff turnover and a loss of experienced practitioners.

A critical challenge facing the Hungarian child protection system, and by extension the services in Ózd, is the issue of understaffing and the resulting excessive caseloads for social workers. A 2025 study on school-based social work provides a stark illustration of this problem. The study found that while the law stipulates a ratio of one social worker per 1,000 children, the actual ratio in 2021 was one social worker for every 1,278 children . This means that social workers are responsible for a significantly larger number of cases than is recommended, which inevitably impacts the quality of care they can provide. The study also notes that there is no centralized data collection on the number of social workers employed in schools, making it difficult to get a complete picture of the staffing situation across the country . This lack of data and oversight is a systemic issue that hinders effective planning and resource allocation.

#### 2.3.2. Impact on Quality of Care and Family Support

The impact of the staffing and resource shortages on the quality of care and family support in Ózd is profound. With social workers struggling to cope with their caseloads, the quality of assessments and interventions is inevitably compromised. Families may not receive the support they need in a timely manner, and children may be left in situations of risk for longer than necessary. The lack of resources also means that there is a limited range of services available to support families, which can make it more difficult to find solutions that are tailored to their specific needs. The result is a system that is often reactive rather than proactive, and that is more likely to resort to the removal of children as a first rather than a last resort.

#### 2.3.3. Challenges in Reintegration and Family Reunification

The challenges in reintegration and family reunification are a direct consequence of the systemic problems in the child protection system in Ózd. When children are removed from their families, there is often a lack of the kind of intensive support that is needed to help the family to address the underlying problems and to create a safe and stable environment for the child's return. Social workers, who are already overburdened, may not have the time to work intensively with the family, and there may be a lack of the kind of specialized services that are needed, such as family therapy and substance abuse treatment. As a result, children can end up spending long periods in care, and family reunification can be difficult to achieve. This is a particular problem for Roma children, who are often seen as being more difficult to place in foster care and who may face additional barriers to reunification.

## 3. National Patterns in Hungarian Child Protection (2003-2023)

Over the past two decades, Hungary's child protection system has undergone a significant transformation, marked by a clear trend towards deinstitutionalization. This shift, which has seen a move away from large-scale orphanages towards smaller, more family-like forms of care, has been a central feature of child protection policy in the country. However, this transition has not been without its challenges, and the system continues to grapple with a range of persistent systemic issues. The role of religious organizations has also become increasingly prominent, raising questions about the quality and professional standards of care. This section will explore these national patterns, examining the progress that has been made as well as the ongoing challenges that continue to affect the lives of vulnerable children in Hungary.

### 3.1. The Deinstitutionalization Trend

The deinstitutionalization of child protection in Hungary has been a long and complex process, driven by a combination of international pressure, domestic policy initiatives, and a growing recognition of the negative impacts of institutional care on child development. The goal of deinstitutionalization is to ensure that children grow up in a family environment, which is seen as being more conducive to their healthy development and well-being. This has involved a concerted effort to reduce the number of children in large-scale institutions and to increase the number of children in foster care and other forms of family-based care.

#### 3.1.1. Shift from Large-Scale Orphanages to Smaller Units

A key aspect of the deinstitutionalization process in Hungary has been the shift from large-scale orphanages to smaller, more family-like units. This has involved the closure of many of the old, Soviet-era institutions, which were often characterized by poor conditions and overcrowding, and their replacement with smaller group homes and other forms of residential care. The aim of this shift has been to create a more nurturing and supportive environment for children, one that is more akin to a family setting. However, the implementation of this policy has been problematic. Many of the new, smaller units have been built in isolated communities, with poorly qualified staff and no access to schools or other essential services . This has made it difficult for children to maintain contact with their biological families and has hindered their reintegration into the community. The quality of care in these smaller units has also been a concern, with reports of high staff turnover, burnout, and a lack of professional supervision. While the shift to smaller units is a positive development in principle, the way it has been implemented in practice has raised serious questions about its effectiveness in improving the lives of children in state care.

Over the past two decades, Hungary has officially pursued a policy of deinstitutionalization (DI), aiming to move away from large-scale, institutional care for children without parental care towards more family- and community-based solutions . This policy, which has been on the government's agenda for over 30 years, represents a significant shift in the philosophy of child protection. The core principle of this reform is to ensure that children grow up in their biological families whenever possible, and when that is not feasible, to prioritize family-based care over institutional settings . The Hungarian government has made declarations supporting this transition, and it has been a key component in securing and utilizing EU funding for social services. However, the implementation of this policy has been fraught with challenges and inconsistencies. While there has been a notable reduction in the number of children in large institutions, the transition has not been uniform across the country, and many systemic issues persist. The process has been criticized for being more of a declarative priority than a fully realized systemic change, with a lack of comprehensive strategy and concrete planning hindering its effectiveness .

#### 3.1.2. Rise of Family-Based Care and Foster Systems

Alongside the shift to smaller residential units, the deinstitutionalization process in Hungary has also involved a greater emphasis on family-based care, particularly foster care. The 1997 Child Protection Act made foster care a priority for children without parental care, and there has been a significant increase in the number of children placed with foster families in recent years. However, the foster care system in Hungary faces a number of challenges. There is a shortage of suitable foster carers, particularly for children with complex needs, and many foster parents are not adequately trained or supported . The financial incentive for fostering is also a concern, with many foster carers in poor rural areas being motivated by the need for income rather than a genuine desire to provide a nurturing home for a child. This can lead to a situation where children are placed in families that are not equipped to meet their needs, and where the quality of care is compromised. The lack of a comprehensive strategy for the development of the foster care system, combined with insufficient funding, has meant that the potential of family-based care to provide a real alternative to institutionalization has not been fully realized.

As part of the broader deinstitutionalization trend, Hungary has placed a growing emphasis on family-based care, particularly through its foster care system. The number of children in foster care has seen a significant increase over the years. In 2014, there were 14,486 children in foster care, and this number has continued to grow . This expansion is a direct result of the government's policy to move children out of institutions and into family environments. The foster care system is seen as a more suitable alternative to institutional care, as it is believed to provide children with a more stable and nurturing environment that is closer to a traditional family setting. The legal framework has been amended to support this shift, with the Child Protection Act specifying that children under the age of 12 should be placed in family-based care unless there are exceptional circumstances . This legal mandate has been a key driver in the expansion of the foster care system and has led to a significant increase in the number of foster families across the country.

#### 3.1.3. Statistical Trends: Declining Numbers in Institutional Care

The policy of deinstitutionalization is reflected in the statistical data on the number of children in different forms of care. While the total number of children in the child protection system has remained relatively stable, there has been a clear shift in the types of placements used. The number of children living in children's homes has been declining, while the number of children in foster care has been increasing. For example, the number of minors placed in children's homes (both temporary and foster care) decreased from 1,807 in 2014 to 1,719 in 2020 . During the same period, the number of minors living with foster parents (both temporary and foster care) increased from 2,038 to 2,748 . This trend is even more pronounced for children with special needs, where the number of those in foster care has grown significantly, indicating a growing confidence in the ability of the foster care system to provide for children with more complex requirements.

This statistical shift is a direct result of the government's policy to prioritize family-based care. The legal and financial framework has been adjusted to support this goal, with a focus on preventing the unnecessary removal of children from their families and on finding family-based solutions when removal is unavoidable. The data also shows a decrease in the number of very young children in institutional care. The number of children under the age of three living in children's homes fell from 363 in 2014 to 313 in 2020, while the number of children in this age group living with foster parents increased from 2,477 to 3,145 . This is a particularly important indicator, as it is widely recognized that early placement in a family environment is critical for a child's development. While these trends are positive, it is important to note that there are still a significant number of children living in institutions, and the pace of deinstitutionalization has been slower than some advocates would like. There are also concerns about the quality of care in some of the remaining institutions and the need for more investment in community-based services to support families and prevent the need for out-of-home care in the first place.

### 3.2. The Role of Religious Organizations

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in Hungary towards the involvement of religious organizations, particularly the Catholic Church, in the provision of child protection services. This has been driven by a government policy that has sought to promote the role of churches in social welfare and has provided them with significant financial and political support. The involvement of religious organizations in child protection has been seen by some as a positive development, bringing new resources and a different approach to the care of vulnerable children. However, it has also raised a number of concerns, particularly regarding the quality and professional standards of the services provided. The following sections will explore the role of religious organizations in Hungarian child protection, examining the dominance of church-run foster care networks, the government policy that has promoted their involvement, and the concerns that have been raised about the quality of their services.

#### 3.2.1. Dominance of Church-Run Foster Care Networks

Religious organizations, particularly the Catholic Church, have become increasingly dominant in the provision of foster care services in Hungary. This is a result of a deliberate government policy to transfer responsibility for social welfare services, including child protection, to churches. The government has provided churches with significant financial support to develop their own foster care networks, and has given them a privileged position in the allocation of resources. This has led to a situation where a large and growing proportion of foster care placements are managed by church-run organizations. While these organizations often have a long history of involvement in social work and may bring a strong sense of mission and commitment to their work, their dominance in the foster care system has also raised concerns. There are questions about the extent to which these organizations are subject to the same level of oversight and regulation as state-run services, and whether their religious ethos is compatible with the principles of child protection, which emphasize the rights and best interests of the child.

In recent years, religious organizations, particularly the Catholic Church, have come to play a dominant role in the provision of child protection services in Hungary. This trend is most evident in the foster care system, where church-run networks have expanded rapidly. In 2016, less than 1% of child protection institutions were provided by religious organizations. By 2019, this number had risen to 50%, and by 2021, it had reached 60% for the 7,000 displaced children and young adults in the system . This rapid expansion has been facilitated by government policies that have actively promoted the participation of churches in social and child protection services. The Szent Ágota Gyermekvédelmi Szolgáltató (St. Agatha Child Protection Service), which is part of the Szeged-Csanádi Diocese, is a prime example of this trend. In July 2020, it was present in 3 counties, but by 2021, it had expanded its services to 13 counties . This demonstrates the speed and scale of the church's involvement in the child protection sector.

#### 3.2.2. Government Policy Promoting Church Involvement

The Hungarian government has actively pursued a policy of promoting the involvement of religious organizations, particularly the Catholic Church, in the provision of social and child protection services. This policy is rooted in a broader political and ideological agenda that seeks to strengthen the role of traditional, Christian values in Hungarian society. The government has used a combination of legal, financial, and political measures to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for child protection services from the state to religious organizations. A key element of this policy has been the bilateral agreement between Hungary and the Vatican, which has provided a legal framework for the increased participation of the church in the social services sector . This agreement has been supplemented by a series of legal amendments and government decrees that have further entrenched the role of religious organizations in the child protection system.

One of the most significant policy changes was the 2020 legal amendment that explicitly promotes the participation of churches in the field of child protection . This amendment has been used to justify the transfer of management of foster care networks from state-run institutions to religious organizations. The government has argued that this shift will improve the quality of care for children by leveraging the resources, expertise, and moral authority of religious organizations. The government has also provided financial incentives to encourage the involvement of churches in social services. This has included direct funding for church-run child protection institutions and tax breaks for religious organizations that provide social services. These financial incentives have made it more attractive for churches to expand their role in the child protection sector and have contributed to the rapid growth of church-run foster care networks.

#### 3.2.3. Concerns Regarding Quality and Professional Standards

The rapid expansion of church-run foster care networks in Hungary has raised significant concerns about the quality and professional standards of the care being provided. While many religious organizations have a long and commendable history of providing social services, the speed and scale of their recent involvement in the child protection sector have outpaced the development of robust quality assurance and accountability mechanisms. One of the primary concerns is the potential for a conflict between the religious mission of these organizations and the professional, child-centered ethos of modern social work. There are fears that the focus on religious instruction and moral guidance may overshadow the need for evidence-based, trauma-informed care that is tailored to the individual needs of each child. This is particularly concerning for children from non-religious or minority religious backgrounds, who may feel alienated or pressured to conform to the beliefs of their caregivers.

The professional qualifications and training of staff in church-run institutions are another area of concern. While some organizations have invested in the professional development of their staff, there are reports that in many cases, the staff are underqualified and lack the specialized training needed to care for children with complex needs. The high staff turnover and burnout rates that have long plagued the child protection sector are also a problem in many church-run institutions. The lack of a stable, experienced, and well-trained workforce can have a detrimental impact on the quality of care and the outcomes for children. The need for a more rigorous system for recruiting, training, and supporting staff in all child protection institutions, regardless of their religious affiliation, is a key challenge that needs to be addressed .

### 3.3. Persistent Systemic Issues

Despite the significant changes that have taken place in the Hungarian child protection system over the past two decades, a number of persistent systemic issues continue to undermine its effectiveness. These issues, which include understaffing, a lack of training and support for foster parents, and bureaucratic obstacles, are not new, but they have been exacerbated by the transition to a more decentralized and community-based system. The failure to address these underlying problems has meant that many children in state care continue to experience poor outcomes, and that the system is not always able to provide the safety, stability, and support that they need. The following sections will explore these persistent systemic issues in more detail, drawing on available data and reports to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges that continue to face the Hungarian child protection system.

#### 3.3.1. Understaffing and High Vacancy Rates in Institutions

One of the most persistent and pressing issues in the Hungarian child protection system is the problem of understaffing and high vacancy rates in institutions. This is a problem that affects all types of residential care, from large-scale children's homes to smaller group homes. The lack of qualified and experienced staff has a direct impact on the quality of care that children receive, and can lead to a situation where the basic needs of children are not being met. The high vacancy rates also place a heavy burden on the existing staff, who are often overworked and underpaid, and can lead to high levels of stress and burnout. This, in turn, can contribute to a high turnover of staff, which can be disruptive for children and can make it difficult to build stable and trusting relationships. The problem of understaffing is a complex one, with a number of contributing factors, including low pay, poor working conditions, and a lack of professional recognition. Addressing this issue will require a concerted effort from the government to improve the terms and conditions of employment for child protection workers and to invest in their training and professional development.

A persistent and critical issue within the Hungarian child protection system is the chronic understaffing and high vacancy rates in both state-run and church-run institutions. This problem has been consistently highlighted in reports by the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights and other oversight bodies, and it has a direct and detrimental impact on the quality of care provided to children . The lack of sufficient staff means that children in care often do not receive the individual attention, emotional support, and specialized care they need. The high workload and stress levels experienced by the existing staff also contribute to a high rate of burnout and staff turnover, which further exacerbates the problem of understaffing. This creates a vicious cycle where the lack of staff leads to a lower quality of care, which in turn makes it more difficult to attract and retain qualified professionals. The statistics on vacancy rates are alarming. In 2020, KSH data showed that more than 10% (394) of the 3,649 positions in care homes were vacant . The situation is even more dire in institutions providing special care, where 164 of the 644 positions were vacant, meaning that one in every four positions remained unfilled .

#### 3.3.2. Insufficient Training and Support for Foster Parents

A significant and persistent challenge within the Hungarian child protection system is the insufficient training and support provided to foster parents. While the policy of deinstitutionalization has led to a greater reliance on foster care, the system has not kept pace with the need to ensure that foster parents are adequately prepared and supported to care for the complex needs of children in care. Many foster parents, particularly those in rural and impoverished areas, are motivated by the financial allowance provided by the state, rather than a genuine desire to provide a nurturing home for a child . This can lead to a situation where the focus is on the financial benefit rather than the well-being of the child, and it can create a risk of exploitation and abuse. The lack of a rigorous screening and assessment process for prospective foster parents is a major contributing factor to this problem.

The training provided to foster parents is often inadequate and does not equip them with the skills and knowledge they need to care for children who have experienced trauma, neglect, or abuse. Many foster parents are not trained in trauma-informed care, and they do not have the skills to manage the challenging behaviors that are often a result of a child's past experiences. The lack of ongoing support and professional guidance can leave foster parents feeling overwhelmed and ill-equipped to handle the challenges they face. This can lead to placement breakdowns, which can be a traumatic experience for a child who has already experienced significant disruption in their life. The need for a more systematic and comprehensive approach to the training and support of foster parents is a key challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure the quality and safety of family-based care in Hungary .

#### 3.3.3. Bureaucratic Obstacles and Lack of Transparency

Another persistent issue in the Hungarian child protection system is the complexity of the legal and administrative framework, which can create bureaucratic obstacles and a lack of transparency. The FRA has noted that the child protection system is regulated by numerous legal rules, which are often amended, making it difficult to have a clear overview of the system as a whole . This fragmentation of the legal framework can lead to confusion and inconsistency in the application of the law, and it can make it difficult for children and families to understand their rights and to navigate the system. There is a need for a more streamlined and coherent legal framework that is easy to understand and that provides clear guidance to all those involved in the child protection system.

The lack of transparency is another significant concern. The 2025 study on school-based social work highlighted the lack of centralized data on the number of social workers employed in schools, which makes it difficult to assess the staffing situation and to plan for future needs . This lack of data is a systemic problem that affects many aspects of the child protection system. Without reliable and comprehensive data, it is difficult to monitor the effectiveness of policies and programs, to identify areas of concern, and to hold the system accountable for its performance. The Hintalovon Child Rights Foundation has called for the development of a clear and consistent system for collecting and reporting data on child protection, as well as for greater transparency in the system as a whole . It is essential that the government takes steps to address these issues, to ensure that the child protection system is accountable, transparent, and responsive to the needs of children and their families.

## 4. Statistical Overview of Children in State Care

A statistical analysis of the number of children in state care in Hungary provides a quantitative measure of the scale and scope of the child protection system. The data, which is collected by the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH) and other government agencies, reveals a number of important trends and patterns over the past two decades. These include a general decline in the number of children in institutional care, a corresponding increase in the number of children in foster care, and a persistent overrepresentation of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The following sections will provide a detailed statistical overview of the children in state care in Hungary, examining the data on foster care, institutional care, and juvenile correctional facilities.

### 4.1. Children in Foster Care (2020-2024)

Foster care has become an increasingly important part of the Hungarian child protection system, with a growing number of children being placed with foster families. This is a positive development in principle, as it is generally recognized that a family environment is more conducive to healthy child development than an institutional setting. However, the statistical data on foster care also reveals a number of challenges and concerns. The following sections will provide a statistical overview of the children in foster care in Hungary, examining the total number of children in foster care, the trends in placement numbers, and the characteristics of the foster care system.

#### 4.1.1. Total Number of Children in Foster Care

The number of children in foster care in Hungary has been steadily increasing in recent years, reflecting the government's policy of prioritizing family-based care. According to data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH), the number of children placed with foster families has grown significantly. In 2021, there were 3,488 family foster carers looking after children, in addition to 2,384 foster carers who specialized in caring for children under three years of age or with a sick or disabled child . This indicates a significant and growing network of foster families across the country. The expansion of foster care has been a key component of Hungary's deinstitutionalization strategy, and has been instrumental in reducing the number of children in large-scale institutions.

The growth in the number of children in foster care has been accompanied by a shift in the types of foster care provided. There has been a move away from traditional foster care, where a child is placed with a family on a long-term basis, towards more specialized forms of foster care, such as respite care and emergency foster care. This reflects a growing recognition of the diverse needs of children in care, and the need for a more flexible and responsive system. However, the expansion of foster care has also brought challenges, including a shortage of foster families, particularly for children with complex needs. There are also concerns about the level of support provided to foster families, and the need for better training and professional development. Despite these challenges, the growth of foster care in Hungary is a positive development, and has the potential to improve the lives of many vulnerable children.

#### 4.1.2. Breakdown by Duration of Stay

The duration of stay in foster care can vary significantly, depending on the individual circumstances of the child and their family. Some children may be in foster care for a short period of time, while others may remain in care for many years. In 2021, the data shows that the system tends to care for children with longer care periods in the foster care network . This suggests that foster care is not just a short-term solution, but is also being used to provide long-term, stable placements for children who cannot return to their families. This is a positive development, as it provides children with the continuity and stability they need to thrive.

However, the data also reveals some of the challenges of the foster care system. In 2021, one in two children changed care, typically from one foster family to another . This high rate of placement changes can be disruptive for children, and can make it difficult for them to form stable attachments. It can also be a sign that the initial placement was not a good match for the child, or that the foster family was not able to meet the child's needs. It is crucial that the system works to reduce the number of placement changes, by ensuring that children are matched with suitable foster families and that foster families are provided with the support they need to provide stable, long-term care.

#### 4.1.3. Trends in Placement Numbers

The trend in foster care placements in Hungary has been one of steady growth over the past two decades. This is a direct result of government policy, which has prioritized family-based care over institutional care. The expansion of foster care has been a key component of Hungary's deinstitutionalization strategy, and has been instrumental in reducing the number of children in large-scale institutions. The growth in the number of foster care placements has been accompanied by a shift in the types of foster care provided, with a move towards more specialized forms of care, such as respite care and emergency foster care.

However, the expansion of foster care has also brought challenges. There is a shortage of foster families, particularly for children with complex needs. There are also concerns about the level of support provided to foster families, and the need for better training and professional development. Despite these challenges, the growth of foster care in Hungary is a positive development, and has the potential to improve the lives of many vulnerable children. It is crucial that the government and child protection agencies continue to invest in the foster care system, to ensure that it is able to meet the needs of all children who require care.

### 4.2. Children in Children's Homes and Institutions (2004-2024)

The number of children available for adoption, who are typically housed in various forms of institutional care, provides a key indicator of the state of the child protection system. Data from the KSH shows a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in the number of registered adoptable children over the last 20 years, with a notable acceleration in recent years. This trend suggests a growing population of children who are unable to remain with their biological families and for whom a permanent family solution through adoption has not yet been found.

| Year | Total Registered Adoptable Children (Dec 31) | Of Which: Disabled or Chronically Ill | Of Which: Under 3 Years Old | Of Which: Over 10 Years Old |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2004 | 2,161 | 331 | 17 | - |
| 2005 | 2,036 | 294 | 19 | - |
| 2006 | 2,191 | 290 | 19 | - |
| 2007 | 2,003 | 261 | 9 | - |
| 2008 | 1,963 | 281 | 16 | - |
| 2009 | 2,088 | 300 | 25 | - |
| 2010 | 2,065 | 291 | 12 | - |
| 2011 | 2,098 | 311 | 13 | - |
| 2012 | 2,213 | 307 | 20 | - |
| 2013 | 2,291 | 322 | 6 | - |
| 2014 | 2,137 | 317 | 9 | - |
| 2015 | 1,893 | 353 | 16 | - |
| 2016 | 1,937 | 316 | 11 | - |
| 2017 | 1,972 | 371 | 10 | - |
| 2018 | 1,890 | 341 | 12 | - |
| 2019 | 1,899 | 370 | 14 | - |
| 2020 | 1,778 | 299 | 11 | - |
| 2021 | 1,693 | 350 | 11 | - |
| 2022 | 1,741 | 401 | 8 | - |
| 2023 | 1,998 | 392 | 25 | - |
| 2024 | 2,095 | 375 | 10 | - |

*Table: Number of Registered Adoptable Children in Hungary (2004-2024) *

The data shows a significant dip in the number of adoptable children in the mid-2010s, with the lowest point being 1,693 in 2021. However, the numbers have since risen sharply, reaching 2,095 in 2024. This recent increase is a cause for concern, as it may indicate a growing number of children entering the care system or a slowdown in the rate of successful adoptions. The data also highlights the vulnerability of these children, with a consistent number of them being disabled or chronically ill, which can make finding adoptive families more challenging.

#### 4.2.1. Total Number of Children in Institutional Care

The number of children in institutional care in Hungary has been steadily declining over the past two decades, as a result of the government's deinstitutionalization policy. This policy has prioritized family-based care over institutional care, and has led to a significant reduction in the number of children living in large-scale institutions. While precise, up-to-the-minute figures for the 2004-2024 period are not readily available in the provided documents, the trend is clear from the data that is available. In 2011, 60% of children in the child protection system were settled in family foster care or family-like small residential group settings, indicating a significant shift away from traditional institutional care .

The decline in the number of children in institutional care has been accompanied by a transformation of the institutions themselves. Many of the large, old-fashioned institutions have been closed down, and have been replaced by smaller, more family-like residential homes. These new facilities are designed to provide a more normalized living environment for children, and to better meet their individual needs. However, the decline in the number of children in institutional care has not eliminated the need for residential care entirely. Some children, particularly those with complex needs, may still require specialized residential services. It is crucial that the government continues to invest in the child protection system, to ensure that all children in care, whether in foster families or residential homes, receive the high-quality support they need to thrive.

#### 4.2.2. Breakdown by Duration of Stay

The duration of stay in institutional care can vary significantly, depending on the individual circumstances of the child and their family. Some children may be in institutional care for a short period of time, while others may remain in care for many years. The data shows that the system tends to care for children with longer care periods in the foster care network, which suggests that institutional care is often used for short-term or emergency placements . However, there are still a significant number of children who remain in institutional care for long periods of time.

The length of time a child spends in care can have a significant impact on their development. Children who spend long periods of time in institutional care are at a higher risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems, and may also have difficulties with their education and social relationships. It is therefore crucial that the system works to reduce the length of time children spend in care, by providing them with stable, long-term placements, either with their own families or with foster families. This requires a proactive approach to family reunification, as well as a greater investment in post-care support for young people who are leaving the care system.

#### 4.2.3. Long-Term Trends in Institutionalization

The long-term trend in Hungary regarding the institutionalization of children shows a clear and deliberate move away from large-scale residential care. This is a core component of the country's deinstitutionalization (DI) policy, which has been a feature of the Hungarian child welfare system for the last 30 years . The historical context for this shift is important. After World War II, the state socialist regime in Hungary, influenced by Soviet pedagogical ideas, promoted a model of communal upbringing in large state-run institutions, which were seen as a modern and politically trustworthy way to raise children . This led to the nationalization of large mansions and the creation of facilities like the "Children's City" in Fót, which at its peak housed around 800 children . This model of institutional care persisted for many years, but in recent decades there has been a growing recognition of its negative impact on children's development.

The current trend is towards a more individualized and family-centered approach. The government has been actively closing down large, overcrowded, and outdated facilities and replacing them with smaller, more "cozy and friendlier" foster homes . This is part of a broader effort to integrate children into society and to give them a real chance to build their own lives. The statistical data reflects this trend. The number of children in children's homes has been steadily declining, while the number of children in foster care has been increasing. This shift is not just about changing the physical environment for children; it is about a fundamental change in the philosophy of child protection, with a greater emphasis on prevention, family support, and the best interests of the child. While the trend is clear, the process of deinstitutionalization is complex and ongoing, and there are still challenges to be addressed in ensuring that all children have access to high-quality, family-based care.

### 4.3. Children in Juvenile Correctional Facilities (Reformatories)

The population of juvenile correctional facilities, or reformatories (*javítóintézetek*), offers another critical data point for assessing the state of child protection in Hungary, particularly at the intersection of the welfare and justice systems. The number of children in these institutions reflects trends in juvenile crime, changes in legislation, and the effectiveness of the state's approach to rehabilitating young offenders. The data from the KSH provides a detailed breakdown of the number of children entering, leaving, and residing in these facilities on an annual basis.

| Year | Entering Reformatories (Pre-Trial) | Entering Reformatories (Final Judgment) | Leaving Reformatories (Pre-Trial Ended) | Leaving Reformatories (Final Judgment Completed) | Total in Reformatories (Dec 31) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2015 | 216 | 199 | 243 | 174 | - |
| 2016 | 265 | 257 | 260 | 185 | - |
| 2017 | 279 | 242 | 268 | 202 | - |
| 2018 | 268 | 235 | 261 | 213 | - |
| 2019 | 262 | 248 | 263 | 215 | - |
| 2020 | 199 | 222 | 215 | 206 | - |
| 2021 | 215 | 234 | 222 | 199 | - |
| 2022 | 227 | 245 | 235 | 210 | - |
| 2023 | 233 | 251 | 244 | 217 | - |
| 2024 | 241 | 258 | 252 | 224 | - |

The data shows a fluctuating but generally stable number of children entering and leaving reformatories each year. The number of children entering on a final judgment has been slightly increasing in recent years, while the number entering for pre-trial detention has remained relatively stable. This suggests that the courts are continuing to use reformatories as a sentencing option for juvenile offenders, despite the broader policy of deinstitutionalization in the child protection system.

#### 4.3.1. Number of Inmates by Age Group

The Hungarian juvenile justice system distinguishes between different types of institutions for children in conflict with the law, including reformatories (*javítóintézet*) and juvenile prisons. Reformatories are multidisciplinary institutions that operate at the intersection of education, child protection, and the justice system. The age of criminal responsibility in Hungary is 14, but children as young as 12 can be held criminally responsible for certain serious offenses if they are deemed to possess the necessary discernment. The data on the number of inmates by age group is not readily available in the provided documents, but it is likely that the majority of children in reformatories are between the ages of 14 and 18.

#### 4.3.2. Placement Reasons: Pre-Trial Detention vs. Final Judgment

The data from the KSH clearly distinguishes between children who are placed in reformatories for pre-trial detention and those who are placed there following a final judgment. This is an important distinction, as it highlights the different legal statuses of the children in these institutions. Children in pre-trial detention are legally innocent until proven guilty, and their placement in a reformatory is a temporary measure to ensure their appearance in court and to protect society. Children who are placed in a reformatory following a final judgment have been convicted of a crime and are serving a sentence. The data shows that a significant number of children are placed in reformatories for pre-trial detention each year, which raises questions about the presumption of innocence and the use of detention as a measure of last resort.

#### 4.3.3. Data on Young Offenders in the Justice System

The data on young offenders in the Hungarian justice system is limited, but it is clear that a significant number of children come into conflict with the law each year. The reasons for this are complex and include poverty, social exclusion, and a lack of access to education and other support services. The child protection system is often involved in the lives of these children, either because they have been removed from their families or because they are at risk of being removed. The data on the number of children in reformatories is just one indicator of the scale of the problem. A more comprehensive approach is needed to address the root causes of juvenile delinquency and to provide these children with the support they need to turn their lives around.

## 5. Qualitative Assessments of Care and Support

A comprehensive assessment of Hungary's child protection system requires moving beyond statistics to examine the qualitative aspects of care and support provided to children in state-run institutions. This involves a detailed look at the living conditions, the quality of education and developmental support, and the availability of emotional and psychological services. Reports from various sources, including oversight bodies, non-governmental organizations, and whistleblowers, paint a concerning picture of a system that often fails to meet the basic needs of its most vulnerable charges. These qualitative assessments reveal a pattern of substandard conditions, inadequate support, and a lack of safety that can have a devastating and long-lasting impact on the lives of the children in its care.

### 5.1. Living Conditions in State-Run Institutions

The living conditions in many of Hungary's state-run child protection institutions have been a source of ongoing concern. Reports from the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights and other monitoring bodies have consistently highlighted issues related to the physical environment, overcrowding, and a lack of safety. These conditions are not just a matter of comfort; they are fundamental to the well-being and healthy development of children. An environment that is unsafe, unsanitary, or lacking in privacy can be deeply traumatizing, particularly for children who have already experienced significant adversity in their lives.

#### 5.1.1. Reports on Substandard Physical Conditions

Reports on the physical conditions in state-run institutions have revealed a range of problems, from dilapidated buildings to a lack of basic amenities. In some cases, children have been found to be living in buildings that are in a state of disrepair, with issues such as leaking roofs, damp and moldy walls, and inadequate heating. These conditions can pose a serious risk to the health of the children, and can also contribute to a sense of neglect and worthlessness. The lack of investment in the physical infrastructure of these institutions is a clear indication of the low priority that is often given to the welfare of children in state care.

#### 5.1.2. Issues of Overcrowding and Lack of Privacy

Overcrowding is a persistent problem in many of Hungary's child protection institutions. This can lead to a lack of personal space and privacy, which is essential for the healthy development of children and adolescents. In overcrowded conditions, children may have to share bedrooms with a large number of other children, and there may be a lack of quiet spaces where they can study or simply be alone. This can lead to increased levels of stress and conflict, and can also make it difficult for children to develop a sense of personal identity and autonomy. The lack of privacy can also be a risk factor for abuse, as it can make it more difficult for children to report incidents of abuse without fear of reprisal.

#### 5.1.3. Safety and Security Concerns

Safety and security are major concerns in many state-run institutions. Reports have highlighted a lack of adequate supervision, which can leave children vulnerable to abuse from other children or from staff. There have also been reports of a lack of security measures to prevent unauthorized individuals from entering the institutions. In some cases, children have been able to leave the institutions without permission, which can put them at risk of harm. The lack of a safe and secure environment can have a profound impact on the emotional and psychological well-being of children, and can make it difficult for them to feel safe and protected.

### 5.2. Education and Developmental Support

Access to quality education and developmental support is a fundamental right of all children, including those in state care. However, the Hungarian child protection system has often struggled to provide these children with the educational opportunities they need to reach their full potential. Children in care are more likely to have experienced disruptions to their education, and they may also have special educational needs that require additional support. The system has a responsibility to address these challenges and to ensure that all children in care have access to a quality education that prepares them for a successful future.

#### 5.2.1. Access to Education for Children in Care

While children in state care are legally entitled to attend school, there are often significant barriers to their access to education. These can include a lack of transportation to and from school, a lack of school supplies and appropriate clothing, and a lack of support from caregivers to help with homework and other school-related activities. Children in care may also face stigma and discrimination from their peers and teachers, which can make it difficult for them to succeed in school. The frequent moves that are common in the care system can also disrupt a child's education, making it difficult for them to form stable relationships with their teachers and peers.

#### 5.2.2. Challenges for Children with Special Educational Needs

Children in state care are more likely to have special educational needs (SEN) than their peers in the general population. This can be due to a range of factors, including prenatal exposure to alcohol or drugs, neglect, and abuse. The child protection system has a responsibility to identify these needs and to provide the necessary support to help these children succeed in school. However, there is often a lack of resources and expertise to meet the needs of children with SEN. This can lead to a situation where these children are not receiving the education they are entitled to, and are not being given the opportunity to reach their full potential.

#### 5.2.3. Vocational Training and Reintegration Programs

For older children in state care, access to vocational training and reintegration programs is essential to help them make a successful transition to independent adulthood. These programs can provide young people with the skills and qualifications they need to find employment and to become self-sufficient. However, there is often a lack of these programs in the Hungarian child protection system. This can leave young people ill-prepared for life after care, and can increase their risk of unemployment, homelessness, and involvement in crime. A greater investment in vocational training and reintegration programs is needed to ensure that all young people leaving care have the support they need to build a positive future for themselves.

### 5.3. Emotional and Psychological Support

The emotional and psychological well-being of children in state care is of paramount importance. Many of these children have experienced significant trauma, including abuse, neglect, and the loss of their families. They need access to a range of mental health services to help them process their experiences and to develop the resilience they need to thrive. The child protection system has a responsibility to provide these services and to create a nurturing and supportive environment that promotes the emotional and psychological well-being of all children in its care.

#### 5.3.1. Availability of Mental Health Services

There is a significant shortage of mental health services for children in state care in Hungary. This includes a lack of psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals who are trained to work with this vulnerable population. The lack of services means that many children with mental health problems are not receiving the treatment they need. This can have a devastating impact on their well-being and can also lead to a range of behavioral problems that can make it difficult for them to succeed in school and in their relationships with others. A greater investment in mental health services is needed to ensure that all children in care have access to the support they need.

#### 5.3.2. Impact of Institutionalization on Child Development

Even in the best of circumstances, institutional care can have a negative impact on child development. The lack of a consistent and nurturing caregiver can make it difficult for children to form secure attachments, which is essential for healthy emotional and social development. The regimented and impersonal nature of institutional life can also stifle a child's creativity and sense of autonomy. Children who grow up in institutions are more likely to experience a range of negative outcomes, including emotional and behavioral problems, difficulties in forming relationships, and poor educational attainment. The move towards deinstitutionalization is a recognition of these negative impacts and an attempt to provide children with a more nurturing and supportive environment.

#### 5.3.3. Support for Victims of Abuse and Neglect

Children who have been victims of abuse and neglect need specialized support to help them heal from their experiences. This can include individual and group therapy, as well as other forms of trauma-informed care. However, there is often a lack of these services in the Hungarian child protection system. This can leave children to cope with their trauma on their own, which can have a lasting impact on their mental and emotional health. A greater investment in services for victims of abuse and neglect is needed to ensure that these children receive the support they need to recover and to build a positive future for themselves.
