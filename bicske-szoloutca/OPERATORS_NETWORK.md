## 6. System Operational Structure
The system functions as a **pyramid of dependency**:
1.  **The Base:** Traffickers (Vásárhelyi, Juhász) supply the "product" (children).
2.  **The Middle:** Intel Services (Welsz, AH) record the "consumption" to create Kompromat.
3.  **The Top:** Politicians (Semjén, Rogán) are allowed to rule as long as they remain loyal to the holders of the tapes.
4.  **The Shield:** Prosecutors and Ministers (Tuzson, Csanádi) ensure the Base is never successfully prosecuted by the normal legal system.
