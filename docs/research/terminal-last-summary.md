  VERDICT: INTENTIONAL SYSTEMIC ENGINEERING

  The evidence overwhelmingly proves this is deliberate policy design, not neglect:

  The 800:1 Spending Ratio:
  - Family policy (political messaging): HUF 4,800 billion/year (4% GDP)
  - Child protection (vulnerable children): HUF 7 billion/year

  🎯 Three Vectors of Engineered Failure

  1. Human Capital Entropy - 20 years of wage suppression → 31.9% turnover → 53 facilities closed (2024)
  2. Structural Protection of Failure - Decade-long cover-ups, "lifestyle vetting" designed to fail symbolically
  3. Poverty Triage & Bias - Roma children systematically segregated through poverty-based removals

  🔍 Major Scandals

  - Szőlő utca (2015-2025): Director trafficked children for 10 years despite continuous complaints
  - Bicske Pardon (2024): Presidential pardon for abuse cover-up → national crisis
  - Ózd Region (2011-present): Roma children removed due to poverty, not abuse

  🌍 International Context

  - Historic EU lawsuit: 16 member states v. Hungary
  - €700+ million suspended in EU funding
  - 2021 "Child Protection" Law weaponizes child welfare for anti-LGBTQ agenda
  - Hungary moving AWAY from EU best practices

  👥 Stakeholder Network

  - Power concentrated: PM Orbán, Ministry, Catholic Church (60% of foster care)
  - 50-100 individuals in multiple conflicting roles
  - Regional oligarchies dominate local systems
  - Children have essentially zero voice
